# A* Pathfinding

This repository contains the source code for `hay-star`; a WIP application written in Haskell for graphing and path finding.

Graphs are stored as binary relations between nodes.

## Features

Current features include taking the symmetric, reflexive, and transitive closures of your graphs, and finding the best-first traversal of a graph.
